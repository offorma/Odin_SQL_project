# Project - SQL
The final milestone in the Odin Project's SQL curriculum was to complete the tutorials and quizzes on [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). I completed all the tutorials, though I only started tracking at tutorial 4. In the project files, I have included the tutorial challenges as comments and the SQL code I wrote to solve the challenges.
### SELECT project FROM the_odin_project WHERE project = 'SQL';
